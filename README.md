AMAZON MQ   is a managed service offered in AWS for RabbitMQ .

But our application is not compatible with the version provided by AWS Amazon MQ . Hence we will stick to creating a VM and install RabbitMQ on the top of it.

```

```
All the terraform code to provision RabbitMQ  will be hosted in this repository
This will be the backend module , which will be called from the root module "terraform-database"
